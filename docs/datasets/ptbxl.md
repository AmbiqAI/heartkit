# PTB-XL Diagnostics Dataset

### <span class="sk-h2-span">Overview</span>

This dataset consists of 21837 clinical 12-lead ECGs from 18885 patients. The ECGs were recorded at a sampling frequency of 500 Hz and a resolution of 16 bits per sample. The dataset includes 21837 ECGs, 21837 ECGs with diagnostic labels, and 21837 ECGs with rhythm labels. The diagnostic labels include 71 classes, and the rhythm labels include 9 classes.

!!! Example Python

    ```py linenums="1"
    from pathlib import Path
    import neuralspot_edge as nse
    import heartkit as hk

    ds = hk.DatasetFactory.get('ptbxl')(
        path=Path("./datasets/ptbxl")
    )

    # Download dataset
    ds.download(force=False)

    # Create signal generator
    data_gen = self.ds.signal_generator(
        patient_generator=nse.utils.uniform_id_generator(ds.patient_ids, repeat=True, shuffle=True),
        frame_size=256,
        samples_per_patient=5,
        target_rate=100,
    )

    # Grab single ECG sample
    ecg = next(data_gen)

    ```
