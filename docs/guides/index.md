# Guides

This section contains guides to help with various aspects of heartKIT. The guides are designed to provide detailed information on how to use heartKIT for different tasks and workflows.

## Core Concepts Guides

<!-- - **[Quickstart](../quickstart.md)**: A quick start guide to get you up and running with heartKIT. -->
- **[Bring-Your-Own-Task](byot.ipynb)**: Demonstrate adding a new task end-to-end.

## Notebook Training Examples

- **[Train Arrhythmia Model](train-arrhythmia-model.ipynb)**: Training a 4-stage arrhythmia model from scratch.
- **[Train ECG Denoiser](train-ecg-denoiser.ipynb)**: Training an ECG denoiser from scratch.
- **[Train ECG Segmentation](train-ecg-segmentation.ipynb)**: Training an ECG segmentation model from scratch.
- **[ECG Foundation Model](ecg-foundation-model.ipynb)**: Create an ECG foundation model.

## Hardware Guides

Several guides are available for running heartKIT models on Ambiq evaluation boards (EVBs) with ECG/PPG sensors connected via the Tileio App. Please check out the [Tileio Demos Page](https://ambiqai.github.io/tileio-docs/demos/) for more information.
