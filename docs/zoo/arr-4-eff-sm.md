## <span class="sk-h2-span">Input</span>

The model is trained on 5-second, raw ECG frames sampled at 100 Hz.

- **Sensor**: ECG
- **Location**: Wrist
- **Sampling Rate**: 100 Hz
- **Frame Size**: 5 seconds

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Class Mapping</span>

The model is trained on raw ECG data and is able to discern normal sinus rhythm (SR) from sinus bradycardia (SBRAD), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), atrial flutter (AFL), supraventricular tachycardia (STACH), and general supraventricular tachycardia (GSVT). The class mapping is as follows:

| Base Class     | Target Class | Label                     |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| 0-SR           | 0            | Sinus Rhythm (SR)         |
| 1-SBRAD        | 1            | Sinus Bradycardia (SBRAD) |
| 7-AFIB, 8-AFL  | 2            | AFIB/AFL (AFIB) |
| 2-STACH, 5-SVT | 3            | General supraventricular tachycardia (GSVT) |
