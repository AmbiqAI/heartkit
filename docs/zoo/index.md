## <span class="sk-h2-span"> Reproducing results </span>

Each pre-trained model has a corresponding `configuration.json` file that can be used to reproduce the model and results.

To reproduce a pre-trained rhythm model with configuration file `configuration.json`, run the following command:

```bash
heartkit -m train -t rhythm -c configuration.json
```

To evaluate the trained rhythm model with configuration file `configuration.json`, run the following command:

```bash
heartkit -m evaluate -t rhythm -c configuration.json
```
