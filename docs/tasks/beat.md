# Beat Classification Task

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Overview</span>

In beat classification, we classify individual beats as either normal or abnormal. Abnormal beats can be further classified as being either premature or escape beats as well as originating from the atria, junction, or ventricles. The objective of beat classification is to detect and classify these abnormal heart beats directly from ECG signals.

!!! example "Class Mapping"

    Below is an example of a class mapping for a 3-class beat model. The class map keys are the original class labels and the values are the new class labels. Any class not included will be skipped.

    ```json
    {
        "num_classes": 3,
        "class_names": ["QRS", "PAC", "PVC"],
        "class_map": {
            "0": 0,  // Map Normal to QRS
            "1": 1,  // Map PAC to PAC
            "2": 2,  // Map PVC to PVC
        }
    }
    ```
