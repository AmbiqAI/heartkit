Introducing HeartKit, an AI Development Kit (ADK) that enables developers to easily train and deploy real-time __heart-monitoring__ models onto [Ambiq's family of ultra-low power SoCs](https://ambiq.com/soc/). The kit provides a variety of datasets, efficient model architectures, and heart-related tasks out of the box. In addition, HeartKit provides optimization and deployment routines to generate efficient inference models. Finally, the kit includes a number of pre-trained models and task-level demos to showcase the capabilities.

**Key Features:**

* **Real-time**: Inference is performed in real-time on battery-powered, edge devices.
* **Efficient**: Leverage Ambiq's ultra low-power SoCs for extreme energy efficiency.
* **Extensible**: Easily add new tasks, models, and datasets to the framework.
* **Open Source**: HeartKit is open source and available on GitHub.

Please explore the HeartKit Docs, a comprehensive resource designed to help you understand and utilize all the built-in features and capabilities.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Usage</span>

__HeartKit__ can be used as either a CLI-based tool or as a Python package to perform advanced development. In both forms, HeartKit exposes a number of modes and tasks outlined below. In addition, by leveraging highly-customizable configurations and extendable factories, HeartKit can be used to create custom workflows for a given application with minimal coding. Refer to the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) to quickly get up and running in minutes.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">[Tasks](./tasks/index.md)</span>

__HeartKit__ includes a number of built-in [tasks](./tasks/index.md). Each task provides reference routines for training, evaluating, and exporting the model. The routines can be customized by providing highly flexibile configuration files/objects. Additionally, new tasks can be added to the __HeartKit__ framework by defining a new [Task class](./tasks/byot.md) and registering it to the [__Task Factory__](./tasks/byot.md).

- **[Denoise](./tasks/denoise.md)**: Remove noise and artifacts from signals
- **[Segmentation](./tasks/segmentation.md)**: Perform ECG/PPG based segmentation
- **[Rhythm](./tasks/rhythm.md)**: Heart rhythm classification (AFIB, AFL)
- **[Beat](./tasks/beat.md)**: Beat-level classification (NORM, PAC, PVC, NOISE)
<!-- - **[Diagnostic](./tasks/diagnostics.md)**: Diagnostic classification (MI, STTC, LVH) -->
- **[Bring-Your-Own-Task (BYOT)](./tasks/byot.md)**: Create and register custom tasks

---

## <span class="sk-h2-span">[Modes](./modes/index.md)</span>

__HeartKit__ provides a number of [modes](./modes/index.md) that can be invoked for a given task. These modes can be accessed via the CLI or directly from a [Task](./tasks/index.md). Each mode is accompanied by a set of [task parameters](./modes/configuration.md#hktaskparams) that can be customized to fit the user's needs.

- **[Download](./modes/download.md)**: Download specified datasets
- **[Train](./modes/train.md)**: Train a model for specified task and datasets
- **[Evaluate](./modes/evaluate.md)**: Evaluate a model for specified task and datasets
- **[Export](./modes/export.md)**: Export a trained model to TensorFlow Lite and TFLM
- **[Demo](./modes/demo.md)**: Run task-level demo on PC or remotely on Ambiq EVB

## <span class="sk-h2-span">[Datasets](./datasets/index.md)</span>

The ADK includes several built-in [datasets](./datasets/index.md) for training __heart-monitoring__ related tasks. We also provide synthetic dataset generators for signals such as ECG, PPG, and RSP along with segmentation and fiducials. Each included dataset inherits from [HKDataset](api/heartkit/datasets/dataset.md) that provides consistent interface for downloading and accessing the data. Additional datasets can be added to the HeartKit framework by creating a new dataset class and registering it to the dataset factory, [DatasetFactory](./models/index.md#model-factory). Check out the [Datasets Guide](./datasets/index.md) to learn more about the available datasets along with their corresponding licenses and limitations.

* **[Icentia11k](./datasets/icentia11k.md)**: 11-lead ECG data collected from 11,000 subjects captured continously over two weeks.
* **[LUDB](./datasets/ludb.md)**: 200 ten-second 12-lead ECG records w/ annotated P-wave, QRS, and T-wave boundaries.
* **[QTDB](./datasets/qtdb.md)**: 100+ fifteen-minute two-lead ECG recordings w/ annotated P-wave, QRS, and T-wave boundaries.
* **[LSAD](./datasets/lsad.md)**: 10-second, 12-lead ECG dataset collected from 45,152 subjects w/ over 100 scp codes.
* **[PTB-XL](./datasets/ptbxl.md)**: 10-second, 12-lead ECG dataset collected from 18,885 subjects w/ 72 different diagnostic classes.
* **[Synthetic](./datasets/synthetic.md)**: A synthetic dataset generator provided by [PhysioKit](https://ambiqai.github.io/physiokit).
* **[Bring-Your-Own-Dataset (BYOD)](./datasets/byod.md)**: Add and register new datasets to the framework.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">[Models](./models/index.md)</span>

__HeartKit__ provides a variety of model architectures geared towards efficient, real-time edge applications. These models are provided by Ambiq's [neuralspot-edge](https://ambiqai.github.io/neuralspot-edge/) and expose a set of parameters that can be used to fully customize the network for a given application.
